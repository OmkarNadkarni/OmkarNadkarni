Hi, I am Omkar Nadkarni currently working as computer vision Engineer at Mark Roberts Motion Control. <br>
I have completed MSc in Artificial Intelligence from Queen Mary University of London.<br>
My primary area of interest is computer vision but I also have experience with natural language processing and AI in games.<br>
I enjoy reading research papers on paperswithcode.com and also spend fair amount of time looking through Kaggle competitions (if you want to collab). <br>
You can reach me on LinkedIn at https://www.linkedin.com/in/omkarn1298/
